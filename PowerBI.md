# Worlds_Death_Analysis
Using Python and Power BI, build an analysis connecting the data from two datasets: One regarding the Life Expectancy and the other the number of deaths by cause across the world.

There are four tabs in the report:

1- WWDA: Life Expectancy:

2- WWDA: Death Cause:

4- WWDA: Life Exp X Death Causes Comparison

In the last tab, we can conclude the following:

Considering the whole world, Life Expectancy is indeed increasing. However, we see that the two biggest death causes, cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms, increased as
the years went by. So why did the Life Expectancy rose so much?
Although these two death causes increased a lot, we can se that two other death causes among the Top 5 had a descrease: neonatal disorders and lower respiratory infections.
At the same time, in the second graph, we see that the rest os the death causes, all summed up, also has a slight decrease.
With this, we can see that the decrease of the neonatal disorders and lower respiratory infections along with the rest of the death causes caused the Life Expectancy to 
increase, suppresing the huge increase of deaths associated to the Top 2 death causes: cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms.
