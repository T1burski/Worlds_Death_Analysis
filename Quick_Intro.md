# Worlds_Death_Analysis
Using Python and Power BI, build an analysis connecting the data from two datasets: One regarding the Life Expectancy and the other the number of deaths by cause across the world.
______________________________________________________

Browsing Kaggle, two completely separate datasets were found. However, they could complement eachother perfectly: One describes the Life Expectancy by year since 1990 across the globe while the other describes the number of deaths by cause in the same period.

With this, firstly, using Python, an initial analysis of the datasets was made, detecting ooutliers and building new dataframes using Pandas in order to facilitate the report building afterwards.

After, the report building was initiated using Power BI.
